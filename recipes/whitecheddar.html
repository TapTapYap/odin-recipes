    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup real bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine macaroni, milk water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high
                heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, 
                stirring frequently so noodles dont stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most
                of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup
                of the parmesan cheese until melted
            </li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remianing 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
            <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. 
                Top with chives and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
