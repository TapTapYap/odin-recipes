# odin-recipes

Really excited to push my first assignment onto github. It may just be a few recipes that I found online but nonetheless it felt really good assembling everything and feeling how everything can start to flow. 

Just going to use this as a space to reflect on my thoughts so far and what I need to work on going forward.

Need to go over commit messages and basically just how to add those because that really confused me when committing my snapshots. I'm sure it is something very simple and basic that I didn't give enough attention to on my first pass through. The basics of HTML have come fairly easily to me so far, the more challenging aspect was managing files through the terminal, pathways and such, as well as working with github. Git/github was what gave me the most trouble but also where I have spent the least amount of my time. I figure that will become much easier in time since I will be using it no matter what I do going forward.

Overall I am really happy with where I am currently and am looking forward to the lessons to come!
